# Projects Overview

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

Scope and Objective: 

This project performs EDA on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns and trends. The analysis supports data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies.

Dataset:

Menu Data: Product offerings and pricing.
Sales Data: Transaction details and customer purchase patterns.

Methodology:

Cleaned and visualized data to identify trends.
Explored relationships between sales figures, product types, and pricing.

Insights: 
The findings provide a foundation for optimizing pricing strategies and improving sales performance.

# 2. Customer Segmentation Analysis

Scope and Objective:

This project aims to segment customers of an e-commerce company based on purchase behavior. The segmentation is intended to improve marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business decisions.

Dataset: 

The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase history, and behavioral data.

Methodology:

Data Preparation:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset for clustering.

Clustering Techniques:

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for segmentation.
Applied clustering algorithms to group customers based on similarity.

Applications: 

Tailored marketing strategies for each segment.
Insights into customer preferences for better decision-making.


# 3. Wine Quality Prediction

Scope and Objective:

The goal of this project is to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties. It applies machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in chemical characteristics, aiding winemakers in quality control.

Dataset:

The dataset consists of chemical properties of wines, such as acidity, alcohol content, and density. These features are used to classify wines into quality categories.

Data Analysis:

Conducted statistical analysis and visualization to uncover relationships between features and wine quality.
Explored significant predictors like alcohol and density.

Modeling:

Four machine learning models were employed:
Random Forest Classifier
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Gradiant Bosting Classifier (GBC)

Key Insights:

Random Forest emerged as the most effective model.
Features like alcohol and density significantly influence quality.

Challenges and Future Work:

Addressed class imbalances.
Proposed ensemble techniques and oversampling methods for further improvement.
